# Privacy Policy for Buydo
**Effective Date:** 2026 Feb 22
**Last Updated:** 2026 Feb 22

This Privacy Policy describes how **Buydo** (the “App”) handles information when you use the App on iOS and Android. The App is a productivity tool for creating and managing shopping lists, tasks, and notes.

## Information We Collect
**We do not collect personal information.** Buydo does not require account creation and does not collect, receive, or transmit personal data to us.

**User content stored on your device.** Any shopping lists, tasks, notes, or other content you create in the App is stored locally on your device. This information is not sent to our servers.

## How We Use Information
Because we do not collect personal information or transmit your content off-device, we do not use your information for analytics, advertising, profiling, or tracking. Your content is used only to provide the App’s features on your device.

## Data Storage
**Local storage only.** Buydo stores App data locally on your device (for example, using on-device storage mechanisms).

**Backups.** Depending on your device settings, your device operating system or platform (e.g., iCloud or Google device backup) may back up App data as part of your device backup. We do not control these backup features. Please review Apple’s or Google’s documentation for information about managing backups.

**Retention and deletion.** You can delete your content within the App (if supported) and you can remove all App data by uninstalling the App. If your device creates backups, you may also need to manage or delete backups through your device settings.

## Third-Party Services
Buydo does **not** use third-party advertising, analytics, or tracking SDKs, and does **not** share data with third parties.

The App is distributed through third-party app stores (such as Apple’s App Store and Google Play). These platforms may collect information as part of providing their services. Any such collection is governed by their respective privacy policies, not this Policy.

## Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since the App does not collect personal information, we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Policy. Your continued use of the App after an update means you accept the updated Policy to the extent permitted by law.
